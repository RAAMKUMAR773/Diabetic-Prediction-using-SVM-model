# Diabetic-Prediction-using-SVM-model
This code builds a **machine learning model to predict diabetes** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm. It first loads the diabetes dataset, explores it using basic statistical analysis, and separates the features (input data) from the target variable (Outcome). The data is then standardized using **StandardScaler** to ensure all features are on the same scale, which improves SVM performance. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a **linear SVM classifier** is trained on the training data. The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both training and test datasets. Finally, the trained model is used to predict whether a new patient is diabetic or not based on given medical input values.
